# Sister Sun, Sister Sky

Now you might have noticed that we called them *Mother* Mountain and *Father* Time. If you're talking about parents, most of the time that implies that there are some children around somewhere. The first two that union produced, we call Sister Sun and Sister Sky.

The first to spring from the mountains was Sister Sun. Her job is to provide light and warmth, and she gets up every morning to do it. Every day, even if there are thick clouds covering her up, she's up there just doin' her best. An embodiment of hard, honest work, just getting what needs to be done, done right. She's not out there for the fame or glory, and is so uninterested in the limelight that she blinds those who try too hard to look at her. If you want her favor, don't bother with worship or gifts--instead, go out and do something that needs to be done. And when the sun starts setting, you can sit and watch as she lets down her red hair, maybe offer a small thanks.

Right behind her was Sister Sky, blue and beautiful.
